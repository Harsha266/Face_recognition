I have used haarcascade classifer to recognize the face through the webcam 
I Added my face as the datasets in folder myImages-->0 ... so you can add your face datasets their.
dataset through web cam is used to get the data set of the person through the webcam.
training_model is used to train the model according to the data set provided in the myImages.

load_model_image is used to test the trained model whether it is working good or not and load_model_video is used to test throught the webcam if the confidence>50 then
it will be unknown face.
